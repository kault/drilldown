# drilldown

A set of tools for renaming files recursively based on regular expressions. I originally created this tool to assist with renaming files hosted on box.com and synced via Box Sync. This allows any changes made locally to be saved to box.com.

Still TODO are better output and command-line options and a clearer way of switching regex groups when renaming files.
